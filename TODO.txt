IMPORTANT NOTE:
  This library is not intended to be a 100% implementation of the
  DxLib interface!

  Throw out the cruft and only allow what makes sense for modern
  portability and hardware acceleration guidelines.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

System:
- DxLib general:
  - No asynchronous loading support anywhere.
- Memory:
  - None of the debugging information is supported or used.
  - Would like Handle to manage its own data heap for allocated stuff.
- Text:
  - HANGEUL, BIG5, GB2312 not supported.
    (Need to embed codepage files. Easy, but no reason to do so yet.)
- Log:
  - Does not exist at this time.

File I/O:
- DXA archiver:
  - Compressed data cannot be streamed incrementally.
    Instead it will load decompress the whole thing into memory and
    stream from there.
- Files:
  - No support for custom streaming functions.

Graphics:
- SDL2Render backend is now broken. Remove it? It is the most portable...
- Functions unsupported:
  - Vertex buffers.
  - Shader filter nonsense.
  - 3D.
  - Any matrix math.
- Movies:
  - No support for movie playback, theora or otherwise.
- Font:
  - Does not support ANTIALIASING_4x4 or 8x8. Will automatically
    fall back to ANTIALIASING.
  - No vertical font rendering.
  - Would like to support other forms of loading fonts in, not just
    ttf. (An option to disable SDL_ttf entirely would be nice.)

Sound:
- AudioBuffer support needs to be split away from AudioInstance.
- The rest of the Mem API needs to be implemented.

Other:
- Input:
  - Multibyte/unicode input not supported.
- Networking:
  - No support whatsoever! (link to SDL2_net?)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Immediate list:
- Switch Draw code to use an index array / have a larger vertex buffer.
- 3d Math (vectors, matrices, etc).
- Vertex buffers.
- Movie playback somehow. (theora or bust)
- Asynchronous loading, yayyyyy.
- Audio revamp.
